# WELCOME
my name is yair medina, I write software sometimes...\
in fact, its a hobby of mine!\
a nice hobby...

##

## BACKGROUND:
I have always been obsesssed with computers,

and at some point in 4th grade we were taught how to use scratch which got me to want to make a real videogame\
so I have watched a few tutorials and started using unity with c#.

6 years later and I now don't make games anymore other then in special occasions\
I have ditched it for server writing, and making apps and tools I would want to use

I am currently after almost 2 years of developing an app\
(until this project my projects only consisted of a server/website (or an offline console app) but never both)\
and it has been one of the most rewarding and interesting processes of my software development journey

can't wait to share it and my future projects with you!\
stay tunedðŸ””
