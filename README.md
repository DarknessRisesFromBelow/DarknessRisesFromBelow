# WELCOME
my name is yair medina, I write software sometimes...\
in fact, its a hobby of mine!\
a nice hobby...

##

## BACKGROUND:
I have always been obsesssed with computers,

and at some point in 4th grade we were taught how to use scratch which got me to want to make a real videogame\
so I have watched a few tutorials and started using unity with c#.

8 years later and I now don't make games anymore other then in special occasions\
I have ditched it for server writing, and making apps and tools I would want to use

can't wait to share my future projects with you!\
stay tunedðŸ””
